    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_extraction : `pyannote.audio.features.FeatureExtraction`
        Feature extraction.
    protocol : `pyannote.database.Protocol`
    subset : {'train', 'development', 'test'}
    per_label : int, optional
        Number of speech turns per speaker in each batch. Defaults to 3.
    label_min_duration : float, optional
        Remove speakers with less than `label_min_duration` seconds of speech.
        Defaults to 0 (i.e. keep it all).
    per_fold : int, optional
        Number of speakers in each batch. Defaults to all speakers.
    per_epoch : float, optional
        Number of days per epoch. Defaults to 7 (a week).
    duration : float, optional
        Use fixed duration segments with this `duration`.
        Defaults (None) to using variable duration segments.
    min_duration : float, optional
        In case `duration` is None, set segment minimum duration.
    max_duration : float, optional
        In case `duration` is None, set segment maximum duration.
    parallel : int, optional
        Number of prefetching background generators. Defaults to 1.
        Each generator will prefetch enough batches to cover a whole epoch.
        Set `parallel` to 0 to not use background generators.
