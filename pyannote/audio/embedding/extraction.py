    Parameters
    ----------
    model : `nn.Module` or `str`
        Model (or path to model). When a path, the directory structure created
        by pyannote-speaker-embedding should be kept unchanged so that one can
        find the corresponding configuration file automatically.
    feature_extraction : callable, optional
        Feature extractor. When not provided and `model` is a path, it is
        inferred directly from the configuration file.
    duration : float, optional
        Subsequence duration, in seconds. When `model` is a path and `duration`
        is not provided, it is inferred directly from the configuration file.
    min_duration : float, optional
        When provided, will do its best to yield segments of length `duration`,
        but shortest segments are also permitted (as long as they are longer
        than `min_duration`). When `model` is a path and `min_duration` is not
        provided, it is inferred directly from the configuration file.
    step : float, optional
        Subsequence step, in seconds. Defaults to 50% of `duration`.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Defaults to 32.
    device : `torch.device` or `str`, optional
        Defaults to CPU.
